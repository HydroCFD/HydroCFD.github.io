excerpt: "This study investigates the behavior of turbulent horizontal dense jets (THDJs) under varying bottom confinement scenarios using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. The experiments aim to extend the current understanding of both mean and turbulent characteristics of these jets as they propagate streamwise up to 75 nozzle diameters (\(75D\)) from the nozzle exit. The selected scenarios avoid typical wall jet and Coanda effects, focusing instead on medium and low bottom confinements. A comprehensive study on the concentration fluctuation field was carried out along and across the trajectories for multiple sections. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis reveals that buoyancy-induced instabilities in the lower layer impede the formation of helical or axisymmetric structures. It turns out that contribution of turbulence in the most confined case (\(H/D = 3\)) was more than the rest of the scenarios."
